# VoiceAssistant
Need to install different packages including webbrowser, speech_recognition, pyttsx3, pyaudio, pywhatkit, datetime, wikipedia, pyjokes, time.

Installing PyAudio might cause problems in some computers depending on version of Python
Either roll back to 3.6 version of Python or 
do this in terminal
```{python, echo=T}
  pip install pipwin
  pipwin install pyaudio
```
